        <p> <!-- style="margin-left:40%"-->
            I'm Musammat, a rising senior at the University of Michigan, studying CompSci. I've studied abroad in South Korea through the CGIS: Summer at Yonsei (YISS) program and I'm currently interning here at Auckland New Zealand through the ISA program. I have learned quite a bit from these experience and want to share them with others who also want to experience them.<br> <br>
            
            I love reading, crocheting, and drawing. My current read is <i>The Mitfords: Letters Between Six Sisters</i>. It's a book I found in a second hand book shop in Auckland and have been obsessed since reading the summary. <br> <br>
 
            I love watching anime and catching up on shows. I'm currently watching Prison Break and have been obsessed with that show as well.

            <p>
                Hey everyone, I'm Musammat! I'm currently studing CS here at Umich. I'm a rising Senior currently. I love reading, drawing, and taking pictures. Being a night owl, you can find me engrosed late reading, crocheting, or editing my photos. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                I also love traveling. The solitude of being in a place where you can't speak the language and have to use GPS to travel anywhere, it's amazing. Or maybe that's the introvert in me talking. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I love being able to wake up on a random morning and take the bus to anywhere and taking in all the newness. Last week, I woke up a random morning and saw this huge patch of green in the MAPS app and although I woke up no plans, I headed there straight after eating breakfast. I hiked the trek to the top, with very difficulty, as I have not exercised in a long while. However, at the top, seeing all of Auckland, New Zealand, I was mesmerized. It was a whole another feeling.
            </p>
                
            <p>
                After I took my share of photos with my camera, I sat on one of the edges and justed hanged out for the next 20 minutes. I felt this peace that I haven't felt in a long time. 
            </p>

            <p>
                So, I love those days, waking up without any concerns and plans and just making it up as you go. 
            </p>

            <p>
                That is the reason I took up studying abroad last summer in South Korea and an international internship this summer in New Zealand. 
            </p>

            <p>
                I love being able to travel while also completing credits, meeting new teachers, and getting an understanding of local study and work culture. 
            </p>


            <p>
                Although I prepared as most as I could, I had a couple of hiccups along the way, especially my first time in South Korea. And so, this is where this website comes in handy. For all you out there who are looking to study abroad, this will be your one stop place for all the info you will need. 
            </p>

            <p>
                And for those that are already studying abroad, if you feel lost and need guidance on things, I welcome you as well. 

                Hope you all have the best study abroad experiences abroad!!
