             <h2>Why Should You Study Abroad?</h2>
             <p>School is over and you have 4 monthes free to do whatever. Many are going to visit family back home or go traveling with friends. But if you don't something planned, maybe you should study abroad.</p>

             <p>Why did I choose to study abroad?</p>

             <p>I was a sophmore during my winter break, back home in detroit, spending time with family. I realized I didn't have nothing to do during this time. I wondered what I would do during my summer break. I knew that we were going back in my home country for my sisters wedding but that'd be only for a month. I really didn't have much to do in the other 3 months. I was trying to find what to do and one day while I was cleaning up, I came across a to-do list from middle school I made with my friend.</p>

             <p>On the list, we wrote down 'visit south korea'. We were in middle school when we planned to visit South Korea together. I was reminded of my younger self who wanted to visit every country. But since then, I never had the chance to travel. Then, my interest to visit South Korea grew incredibly. But why did I choose study abroad and not just travel? Like many other students, I wanted to keep up with studies while also traveling.</p>

             <p>So, that's how I decided to study abroad, nothing grand. I just wanted to travel while also gaining some experience.</p>

            <h2>Study Abroad or Internship Abroad</h2>
            <p>Are you having difficulty choosing a program? Don't know whether to choose a study or internship abroad? Struggling between which location to choose? Not sure which organization to go with? Well, I had all those worries before my first study abraod. But now, I'm ready to help you find the perfect program for you!</p>
            
            <p>The first thing is to find what you are looking for. Do you want a laid back summer with lot's of travel or are you looking to gain some experience abroad? That is something that will take some time to answer but it will be the gateway to find your right program.</p>

            <p>For those of you who are really unsure about about the direction, I will suggest that if you are a freshman, you should go for a study abroad experience. This will offer you to take some classes and ample amount of time to travel. But if you are still looking to gain some experience, there are many programs that offer an internship component along the abroad abroad experience. But that'll definitely leave you with much less time to travel.</p>

            <p>If you are a sophmore or a junior, I would strongly recommend to choose an internship abroad experience. During that time, it is best you gain some experience. If travel is important, most internship abroad experiences have options where you opt into a shorter work week, like 24hr or 32 hr week. That can leave you with 3 to 4 days to travel each week. During this time, it's best to build your resume so I would prioritze doing an internship.</p>

            <p>Aside from those two options, you can also do research abroad, though I have a limited understanding of it.</p>

            <p>Ok, now you know the type of abroad experience you want. But what about location? There are hundreds to chose frok. If you are having trouble choosing a location, you can read my next artcile!! </p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item" id="3.location">
            <h2>Where to Study Abroad?</h2>
            <p>Now that you know what type of experience you are looking for, what location should you go with? Right away, I would suggest to go to the place that you have been planning to visit for a long time. LIke how I choose South Korea, go with the one place that you have wanted to visit for the longest time ever./p>

            <p>If you have no such place like that and are open to going anywhere, I would first suggest figuring out what type environments you like. Do you like sunny summers in beaches, or a temperate weather or maybe you like the winter? What about the things you want to accomplish during your summer? Are you looking to hike more, learn street photography, or maybe you want to learn Japanese? Do want to visit as many countries as possible or do you want to visit one obscure place that you wouldn't visit in normal circumstances? Answering these questions will help you choose between Greece and Australia, Brazil and Japan, and Germany and Nepal. </p>

            <p>If you are looking to make the most of your money, then it'd be best to choose a country in Asia. But know the difference between the popular Asian countries. South Korea would be more expensive than China or Vietnam.But out of all those countries, your money would go better in Central Asia, like Uzbekistan.</p>

            <p>It's really important to understand the climate of the country during your visit. I was in South Korea in June and July. I was from a tropical country and was somewhat used to monsoons but I didn't expect monsoon level rain in South Korea. Their rainy season was during those months but since I wasn't prepared, I didn't bring any appropiate clothing. The rain and extreme humidity ruined so many planned experiences I had.</p>
            
            <p>So, it's really important to research the weather of the country and know fully what you are going into. Being prepared and ready would be the only way to make the most of your experience.</p>

            <p>In a simmilar note, make sure that you are fully aware of the culture in that country. If you have certain beliefs, whether religious or personal, make sure that the country of your choice allows you to fully express those beliefs and practices. It wouldn't be smart for a vegan person to go to Mongolia or Kazakhstan, where meat is eaten nearly for every meal. It's understandable to want to go to a country where the culture is different from your home country but make sure that the difference doesn't affect your life greatly.</p>

            <p>Well, that was a lot but hopefully I gave you something to think about if you were really clueless before.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="info-item" id="4.organization">
            <p>So, you have some idea about what you are looking for but now you are wondering which organization to go with out of the hundreds. There is CIEE, ISA, IES, and more.</p>

            <p>First, find the programs that match what you want to do regardless of organization. So, now you have narrowed down your options to 10 or less. From here on out, you should find the differences between the programs. The best way to do that would be to rea reviews from previous participants. You can compare the formal overals all you want, but what really matters is how they respond in unusual circumstances, and you can only find that out thorugh reviews. </p>

            <p>Sometimes the organization matters sometimes it doesn't. While I was studying abroad i South Korea, everything went smoothly that I never needed to contact the program.If you anticipate that you ned specail assistance thorughout the program, please do take a couple of days of research thoroughly so you can have your best experience abroad.</p>

            <p>When you are doing your research, what should you be looking out for? Well, how do you like to do things? Would you rather be the one to find your own housing or would you rather the program does it for you? Do you want to meet up with the other students in your program or would you rather do your own thing? Those things all depend on the type of organiztion and program. Some of these information may not be online so you should take time to call the program managers to find more info.</p>

            <p>With the experience I have with ISA, I can say that they help a lot individually. You get to personnaly know your local program managers and you can chat with them whenever if you have questions or need help.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="info-item" id="5.finances">
            <p>Every study abroad program costs a lot and even the unpaid internships cost as as well. My South Korea study abroad was seven thousand and my recent program cost is about thirteen thousand! So, how do you go about paying for it? Obiously dad's money! Not really, this summer, we are all gooing to be financially independent girlies. It's possible to cover most of your program costs but how?</p>

            <p>Scholarship. Scholarship. Scholarship.</p>

            <p>There are many sources you can get scholarship from: your school department, college, university scholarships, local scholarships, and national scholarships. Your school is going to be the best place to look for scholarships. The first place you should check in with is your financial aid office. You can email them asking for scholarships available for studying or interning abroad. Then, your second best place is to check in with your college, whether it is with engineering or language arts. They have department scholarships that they offer to studying abroad. Most of my scholarships came from my department and the second best was from the office of financial aid.</p>

            <p>Okay, so you have checked in with your financial aid office and your deparment. Now, you should check if your study abroad program offers their own scholarships. Both my programs offered their own scholarships. They offered both need and merit based, so there is aid for every type of student. Then, next move should be to apply to national scholarships, such as the gilman scholarship and the Boren Awards for International Study. There are many scholarships available for studying abraod. </p>

            <p>For scholarship, the important thing is to apply early as possible. For Summer /p>
